# NodeMCU based Fish Feeder v2
---

## Status: Work In Progress

---
### Fish Feeder v2 consists of
* ESP8266/NodeMCU Microcontroller
* 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver
* Custom built wood stand with height adjustment
* Powered via USB

The first version of this project was an automatic fish feeder that would feed once per day with a capacity for 16 days of feeding.  Version 2 is physically the same but will have an upgraded web server, enchanced function control and better status monitoring.

#### Work in Progress:
* Set parameters via webpage
  * Set number of feedings
  * Set time of feedings
  * Test feeder
  * Nudge feeding disk forward/backward
* Add RGB Lighting for day/night cycles
